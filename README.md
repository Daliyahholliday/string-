# string-library

In this assignment, I learned how to design a Python library by implementing custom functions for string manipulation without relying on built-in string methods. This process helped me understand ASCII character encoding and how to use ord() and chr() functions to work directly with character codes. I also gained insight into the importance of defining constants and structuring functions to perform specific tasks like checking if a string is alphabetic, converting case, and replacing characters.

To complete the assignment, I started by defining constants for lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits. Then, I implemented each function according to the specifications, beginning with simpler checks (is_alpha, is_digit) and moving to more complex replacements and searches. Each function was tested to ensure it handled all specified cases, including edge cases like empty strings and length requirements. This structured approach helped me meet the requirements while deepening my understanding of string processing in Python.
